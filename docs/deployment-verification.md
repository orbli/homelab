### ✅ Current Status

All components are successfully deployed with proper GitOps management through ArgoCD.

### 📊 Summary

**Coverage Status**: **YES** - All deployed components have corresponding installation scripts

**Directory Organization**:
- `01-setup/`: Infrastructure and cluster foundation (8 scripts)
- `02-install/`: Application deployments (7 deployment scripts + 3 cleanup scripts)

**All Components Managed Via GitOps**:
1. `ArgoCD Core` → `02-install/01-install-argocd.yaml` + `02-argocd-self-hosting.yaml`
2. `Cloudflare Tunnel` → `kubernetes/argocd/cloudflared/` (ingress controller; hostnames are Ingress objects in each app)
3. `Keycloak` → `02-install/04-deploy-keycloak.yaml`
4. `Loki + Alloy` → `02-install/05-deploy-log-collection.yaml`
5. `Grafana OAuth` → `02-install/06-config-grafana-oauth.yaml`
6. `Prometheus + Grafana` → `02-install/07-deploy-prometheus-grafana.yaml`
7. `Tailscale Operator` → `01-setup/09-install_ts_k8s_operator.yaml`
8. `NFS CSI Driver` → `01-setup/07-install_k8s_sc.yaml`

## Key Features

1. **GitOps Management**: All infrastructure managed through ArgoCD
2. **OAuth Integration**: Grafana integrated with Keycloak for SSO
3. **Complete Observability**: Prometheus metrics + Loki logs + Grafana dashboards
4. **Network Security**: Tailscale for secure access, Cloudflare for public exposure

## Reinstallation Order

If rebuilding from scratch:

1. **Phase 1 - Infrastructure** (01-setup):
   ```bash
   01-install_shared_drive.yaml
   02-install_worker_ros.yaml
   03-setup_worker_ros.yaml
   04-install_ts.yaml
   05-install_k3s.yaml
   06-install_helm.yaml
   07-install_k8s_sc.yaml
   ```

2. **Phase 2 - GitOps** (02-install):
   ```bash
   01-install-argocd.yaml
   02-argocd-self-hosting.yaml
   ```

3. **Phase 3 - Core Services** (02-install):
   ```bash
   (Cloudflare Tunnel: kubectl apply -f kubernetes/argocd/cloudflared/ after creating its Secret)
   04-deploy-keycloak.yaml
   09-install_ts_k8s_operator.yaml (from 01-setup)
   ```

4. **Phase 4 - Observability** (02-install):
   ```bash
   05-deploy-log-collection.yaml
   06-config-grafana-oauth.yaml
   07-deploy-prometheus-grafana.yaml
   ```
