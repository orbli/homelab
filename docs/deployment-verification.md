# Deployment Verification Report

## Current State vs Installation Scripts

### ‚úÖ Complete Coverage (Deployed + Scripts Exist)

| Component | Namespace | Helm Release | Installation Script | Status |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Keycloak** | iam | keycloak (failed status) | `02-install/01-keycloak.yaml` | ‚ö†Ô∏è Failed deployment |
| **Cloudflare Tunnels** | networking | Manual deployment | `02-install/02-cloudflared.yaml` | ‚úÖ Running |
| **Loki** | observability | loki | `02-install/04-install_monitoring_storages.yaml` | ‚úÖ Running |
| **Prometheus Stack** | observability | kube-prometheus-stack | `02-install/04-install_monitoring_storages.yaml` | ‚úÖ Running |
| **K8s Monitoring (Alloy)** | observability | k8s-monitoring, alloy-logs, alloy-singleton | `02-install/05-install_monitoring.yaml` | ‚úÖ Running |
| **ArgoCD** | devops | Removed | `02-install/03-install_argocd.yaml` / `03-install_argocd_headless.yaml` | üîÑ Ready to redeploy |

### üîç Infrastructure Components (from 01-setup)

| Component | Script | Purpose | Status |
|-----------|--------|---------|--------|
| **NFS Storage** | `01-setup/01-install_shared_drive.yaml` | Shared storage setup | ‚úÖ Deployed |
| **Worker Setup** | `01-setup/02-install_worker_ros.yaml` | Node configuration | ‚úÖ Deployed |
| **Tailscale** | `01-setup/04-install_ts.yaml` | Network connectivity | ‚úÖ Deployed |
| **K3s** | `01-setup/05-install_k3s.yaml` | Kubernetes cluster | ‚úÖ Deployed |
| **Helm** | `01-setup/06-install_helm.yaml` | Package manager | ‚úÖ Deployed |
| **Storage Class** | `01-setup/07-install_k8s_sc.yaml` | NFS CSI driver | ‚úÖ Deployed (csi-driver-nfs) |
| **Tailscale Operator** | `01-setup/09-install_ts_k8s_operator.yaml` | K8s Tailscale integration | ‚úÖ Deployed |

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Found

1. **Keycloak**: Helm release shows "failed" status - needs investigation
2. **Missing Script**: No dedicated script for Tailscale Operator in `02-install/` (it's in `01-setup/`)

### üìä Summary

**Coverage Status**: **YES** - All deployed components have corresponding installation scripts

**Directory Organization**:
- `01-setup/`: Infrastructure and cluster foundation (8 scripts)
- `02-install/`: Application deployments (7 scripts + 1 removal script)

**All Helm Releases Accounted For**:
1. `csi-driver-nfs` ‚Üí `01-setup/07-install_k8s_sc.yaml`
2. `k8s-monitoring` ‚Üí `02-install/05-install_monitoring.yaml`
3. `k8s-monitoring-alloy-*` ‚Üí `02-install/05-install_monitoring.yaml`
4. `keycloak` ‚Üí `02-install/01-keycloak.yaml`
5. `kube-prometheus-stack` ‚Üí `02-install/04-install_monitoring_storages.yaml`
6. `loki` ‚Üí `02-install/04-install_monitoring_storages.yaml`
7. `tailscale-operator` ‚Üí `01-setup/09-install_ts_k8s_operator.yaml`

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Keycloak**: Investigate why Keycloak Helm release is in failed state
   ```bash
   helm status keycloak -n iam
   kubectl describe pods -n iam
   ```

2. **Consider Reorganization**: Move Tailscale Operator script from `01-setup/` to `02-install/` for consistency

3. **Add Validation Scripts**: Create health check scripts for each component

4. **Document Dependencies**: Some components depend on others (e.g., monitoring needs storage class)

## Reinstallation Order

If rebuilding from scratch:

1. **Phase 1 - Infrastructure** (01-setup):
   ```bash
   01-install_shared_drive.yaml
   02-install_worker_ros.yaml
   03-setup_worker_ros.yaml
   04-install_ts.yaml
   05-install_k3s.yaml
   06-install_helm.yaml
   07-install_k8s_sc.yaml
   ```

2. **Phase 2 - Core Services** (02-install):
   ```bash
   01-keycloak.yaml
   09-install_ts_k8s_operator.yaml (from 01-setup)
   02-cloudflared.yaml
   ```

3. **Phase 3 - Observability** (02-install):
   ```bash
   04-install_monitoring_storages.yaml
   05-install_monitoring.yaml
   ```

4. **Phase 4 - GitOps** (02-install):
   ```bash
   03-install_argocd_headless.yaml
   ```
